This is a Test Repository for my Arduino Projects.
It is set up to use my Google Drive as the local
File store.  I am interested to see if this will
allow me to have the central local repository on
my Google Drive that can then be accessed from
all my different machines. The added benefit
being that the files are "safe" and synchronised
and the a hard disk crash or other local machine
problem does not take my files with it.
Of course, github provides this for my committed
files anyway.
This repository is for general Arduino info, I 
will create individual repositories for each 
project.  Will investigate the "best practice"
for this by viewing others setups.
